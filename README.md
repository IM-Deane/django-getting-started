# Django Getting Started Tutorial

**Author: Tristan Deane**

## Description

This project marks the beginning of my exploration into the Django framework. It
was created while following the official docs **Getting Started**
[tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/contents/).

### Takeaways

This project has taught me the basics regarding Django. In particular, i've
learned the following:

- Starting a new Django Project
- The structure of Django apps
- Creating an "app" and how these differ from Projects in Django.
- SQL Database migrations
- Importing and using static files
- The concept of views (ie. routes) and using HTML templates to render them.
- Testing in Django
- The built-in Admin interface and how to customize/override it.

Obviously, the above list is just the tip of the iceberg in regards to the
Django ecosystem. After finishing this tutorial my next task will be to practice
what i've learned. I will also be exploring how to use React.js as the
applications front-end.
